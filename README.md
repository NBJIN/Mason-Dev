### c) Color Scheme
The color schemes utilised in this project are white, gold and black.  Red was chosen for the hover links so to make the links stand out when they are hovered over.  White, gold and black were chosen for the main website as they contrast each other and the white text stands out against the black background giving it a sleek and professional look.  

The main background color is black  -  this allows text to be easily readable on the page along with the logo and navigational items.  
Hex color code `#000000`

![image](https://github.com/NBJIN/Mason-Dev/assets/106515976/6d3236d4-d251-44fe-9bfb-ce3982ca374a)


Gold is used for the navigation bar banner, social media banner, logo, return to home and submit buttons. The gold color compliments the black background and again allows for easily reading of content.  

Hex color code  `#EAC452`

![image](https://github.com/NBJIN/Mason-Dev/assets/106515976/968ca723-afae-4985-8b72-315a812a23bc)

White has been used for all text in the main body and footer element on each page.  Black text is used in the navigational bar, social meida banner, return to home button and submit button as there is a good contrast with black text on a yellow background.  

### d) Typography 
The main font used for this project is Raleway.  Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family.

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway

The fallback fonts from Raleway are aerial and sans-serif.  

Edwardian script itc has also been used for the name of the development.  This is a dynamic script font carefully created with a touch of chic calligraphy.
