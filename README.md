### c) Color
The color schemes utilised in this project are white, gold and black. These colors were chosen as they contrast each other and the white text stands out against the black background giving it 
a sleek and professional look.  

The main background color is black  -  this allows text to be easily readable on the page along with the logo and navigational items.  
Hex color code `#000000`

Gold is used for the navigation bar banners, logo and return to home button - this gold color compliments the black background and again allows for easily reading of content.  

Hex color code  `#EAC452`

![image](https://github.com/NBJIN/Mason-Dev/assets/106515976/968ca723-afae-4985-8b72-315a812a23bc)

White has been used for all text in the main body and footer element on each page.  Black text is used in the navigational bar, social meida banner and return to home button as there is a better contrast with black text on a yellow background.  

### d) Typography 
The main font used for this project is Ralway.  Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family.
