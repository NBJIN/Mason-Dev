## 4 Testing 
#
### a) Testing User Stories 
- As a user i want to easily navigate through the website so that I can find information about the housing development eg amenities, location, name, video and images.   
 The website has a very clear navigational bar where there is links to the Home, Specifications and 
 Contact Us Page and when the user completes the form in the contact us page they are brought to the 
 success page informing the user that their enquiry has been received. On the home page there there details about the development for example name, where it is located,  amenities and energy rating details and there is also a video showing an overview of the development  giving the visitor an ariel view of the development.  The footer holds the links to social media links facebook, twitter and instagram.  The navbar allows the user to naviage to the specifications page  where the user can 
 get a sense of the layout  of each house type by reviewing the images for   internal and external layout and design.  It informs the user there is two house types and gives  the names for each.
